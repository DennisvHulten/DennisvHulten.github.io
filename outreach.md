I gave an oral presentation on the molecular ecology of monospecific stands of _Madracis auretenra_ on the reefs of Curacao at ECRS 2024 in Napoli. 
My presentation was part of session 2: "Coral reef structure and functioning".

# Outreach
### August 19th 2024
Together with a passionate group of students I helped organise a workshop on conservation and regenerative projects for Green Jam 2024!
Green jam was held on August 19th at the Auckland city zoo and is an event focussed on teaching highschool studens more about sustainability and environment. It was great seeing all the kids interested in finding their own journey towards a better and greener future!

### October 24th till October 31st 2024
I had the amazing privalage to join the Inkfish team as one of the volunteers that got the opportunity to share some of our science and teach some of the young students of the Kingdom of Tonga as part of the Inkfish Tonga expedition 2024. During this week we visited a youth camp and organised a few days of marine science oriented workshops for some of the local schools. It was an incredible experience to get to share some of our work with the amazing kids of Tonga and we had a great time answering all their questions about coral reefs and photogrammetry!
