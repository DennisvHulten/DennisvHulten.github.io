### Research topics:
coral reef ecology, population genomics, marine biology, photogrammetry, habitat mapping

### My research:
My research is focused on dominant and common coral species that form monospecific stands on tropical coral reefs. A monospecific stand is defined as an area within a larger ecosystem where at least 60% of the canopy cover is occupied by a sigular species. In other words, a monospecific stand is an area that visually stands out from its surroundings by a unusual dense aggregation of a single species. Some common and well recognizable examples of this phenomena are pine forrests, dense bramble thickets or reed marshes. We can also find monospecific stands in marine environments, think for example of a kelp forrest, a seagrass bed or a sponge garden. 

Monospecific stands are also found on coral reefs. A prime example of this can be found by looking at thickets of _Acropora cervicornis_ or _Madracis auretenra/mirabilis_ two beautiful Carribean corals. In the Pacific the coral species _Pocilopora damicornis_ is well known for forming monospecific stands that can encompass entire reefs and outcompete other coral species.
