coral reef ecology, population genomics, marine biology, photogrammetry, habitat mapping

### My research:
My research is focused on dominant and common coral species that form monospecific stands on tropical coral reefs. A monospecific stand is defined as an area within a larger ecosystem where at least 60% of the canopy cover is occupied by a sigular species. In other words, a monospecific stand is an area that visually stands out from its surroundings by a unusual dense aggregation of a single species. Some common and well recognizable examples of this phenomena are pine forrests, dense bramble thickets or reed marshes. We can also find monospecific stands in marine environments, think for example of a kelp forrest, a seagrass bed or a sponge garden. 

Monospecific stands are also found on coral reefs. A prime example of this can be found by looking at thickets of _Acropora cervicornis_ or _Madracis auretenra/mirabilis_ two beautiful Carribean corals. In the Pacific the coral species _Pocilopora damicornis_ is well known for forming monospecific stands that can encompass entire reefs and outcompete other coral species. 

In order to properly study and document the genetic diversity captured within monospecific stands I have developed a workflow that builds upon the Reefscape genomics approach [Bongaerts, 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.638979/full). In this workflow we use 3D models of the reef to select which corals we want to sample before we get into the water. This will help us collect samples in an unbiased mannor and ensures even spacing between samples. See a graphic representation of the workflow below:
