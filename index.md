## About me
I am a marine biologist currently part of the [reefscape genomics lab](https://www.reefscapegenomics.com) @ [The California Academy of Sciences](https://www.calacademy.org/).
I was born in the Netherlands and have recently moved to Aotearoa, New Zealand to study at the University of Auckland. 

My research is focused on dominant and common coral species that can be found on tropical coral reefs. My main interest is in the spatial aggregation of these dominant species into monospecific stands. In my research I combine photogrammetry and genomic techniques to better understand the interaction between the physical environment and the genomic population structure found in monospecific stands.
