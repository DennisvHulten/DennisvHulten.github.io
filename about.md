## About me
Currently part of the [reefscape genomics lab](https://www.reefscapegenomics.com) @ [California Academy of Sciences](https://www.calacademy.org/)

My research is focused on dominant and common coral species that can be found on tropical coral reefs. My main interest is in the spatial aggregation of these dominant species into monospecific stands.
